          <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-5">The purpose of this project is to build an “Online Bidding System”, a place for buyers and sellers to come together and trade almost anything. User can see the feature of this site without registration but for Bidding and selling user must be registrated.
  Auctions have a name, a description, possibly a photo (of the related item) uploaded by users and an end period: users cannot place bids when the auction interval (start - end period) ends, but, in case there were no offers for an item, there is the possibility to extend the interval. Moreover, administrators have the possibility to accept or refuse auctions proposed by users, to view information about users and items and to create, modify and delete the categories of auctions (auctions regarding cars,Mobile,Computer). </p>
